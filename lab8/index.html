			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks in Javascript. In addition,
						we added the JS to the head rather than the body so that you need to inspect > console in order to see the JS run.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that came up was figuring out why my JS wasn't printing and then I realized that it said "Go to Console to see."
						which would mean I had to inspect the website and click console. I was a bit stuck thinking that my code was broken only to realize
						it was not. 
					</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab went pretty well because it was explained in depth during class.
