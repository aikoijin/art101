			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to learn and practice data types and variables in Javascript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I did not have a computer for this lab so it was quite difficult trying to visualize the code and understand the concepts.
						However, Ashley helped explain the lab and Javascript jargon to me in a clear and easy way to understand. I also didn't
						quite understand why we had to use JSON.stringify instead of code but after some quick research realized that code was for HTML
						to print it as computer code and not JS objects.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Due to my situation, Ashley and I worked closely together in-person at Mchenry library and switched off roles programming.
						I think that the coding was relatively easy after I got the core foundation down of ; at the end and declaring, assigning, then referencing the variables.
					</p>
