					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge of this lab was to use jQuery to create a form in which the input was the user's name
						and after submitting, you get an anagram of the name.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Some problems that arose during this lab was trying to get the anagram to print/work as I copied
						the code from my Lab 7 since I did the anagram for that. However, having the example during class definitely helped
						and I got the anagram to work after rewatching the lecture. In addition, I wanted to make the anagram Capitalize
						so I had to do some digging and research on the web to implent that.
