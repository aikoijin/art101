			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<p>The idea of this lab was to understand the importance of file structure and making all file names lowercase and no spaces and to add index.html files.</p>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The lab was relatively easy and did not prove to be difficult other than navigating how to pull my image from my img folder and placing it in the website. ../ was the error I missed.</p>

					<p>Below is the index.html file I created. Here is the file structure I made. </p>
