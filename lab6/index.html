			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to allow us to practice using arrays and objects in Javascript and implementing them into HTML.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had problems getting the age to be printed on the HTML. In addition, I forgot to put the words in quotation marks which caused my array
						to not work and also forgot the ; at the end of each line which also caused some confusion trying to get the JS to work.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think the lab assignment was relatively easy once we got into the flow of Javascript and remembering to end each line with a ; and
						also using JSON.stringify to paste our code into HTML.
					</p>
